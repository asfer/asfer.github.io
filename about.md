![Delirium](/images/delirium.jpg)

I am a portuguese software developer currently living in the beautiful garden that is Kent (England).

If you are also an afficionado maybe you can tell from the photo that I enjoy belgian beer a lot! The photo was taken at the [Delirium Caf√©](http://www.deliriumcafe.be/?___store=deliriumcafe_en) in Brussels.

My main interests are machine learning and data mining but I also enjoy the foundations of computer science like algorithms and compilers, which I am currently revisiting.
